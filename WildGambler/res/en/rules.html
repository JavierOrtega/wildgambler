                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    Wild Gambler is a 20-line slot with an African Wildlife theme. The game features a Free Spins bonus game and also has a feature where the player can choose to keep wilds from one spin to the next with a different cost for the spin based on where the wilds are.
                </p>

                <h2>Getting Started</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Tap the '+' and '-' buttons to choose a line bet.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The number of win lines is fixed at 20.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The total bet will be shown above the Spin button.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Tap on the 'INFO' button in the side menu to view the paytable, which shows the potential winnings for getting different numbers of each symbol.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h2>How To Play - Basic Spin</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Tap 'SPIN' to start the game.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The reels will spin and eventually stop at random. (You can tap SPIN again to speed up the reel spin).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If the combination of symbols appearing on the reels forms a line win of 3, 4 or 5 matching symbols (starting from the left) then you win.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Any symbols that form part of a win will then animate and the win amounts shown accordingly.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        All wins are based on the stake per line value multiplied by the value for the wins awarded.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h2>How To Play - LOCK &amp; SPIN</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        In 'LOCK &amp; SPIN' any wild symbols on the reels will be locked and will stay in place for the next spin. All other symbols will be changed.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Because keeping wild symbols increases the chance of getting wins (and guarantee wins in some cases) the cost of doing this is much higher than a normal spin.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The cost is shown above the 'LOCK &amp; SPIN' button and will vary depending on where the wilds are on the reels.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If the cost for the spin has gone up a lot compared with the normal spin then when the 'LOCK &amp; SPIN' button is tapped a warning message will be shown asking if you want to continue.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        As with a normal spin, all wins are based on the stake per line value (not the total cost paid to spin).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Tap the 'LOCK &amp; SPIN' button to start the spin.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The first time you select 'LOCK &amp; SPIN' a message will be shown asking if you are sure you want to make this bet as the stake is higher than the normal spin stake. There will also be a checkbox asking if you want new wilds to be automatically locked for the next 'LOCK &amp; SPIN' (which is the default) or to instead only keep the selected wilds. If any new wilds that appear on the reels are locked then the stake for the next 'LOCK &amp; SPIN' will increase accordingly (due to the greater chance of wins).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The setting  controlling whether new wilds automatically lock or not can be found in the SETTINGS  menu.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Wild Symbols</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Wild symbols can substitute for any other symbol to help form wins.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Wild symbols also award a win themselves if there are 5 of them on a win line.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        During Free Spins any wilds that appear will stay in place for the remaining spins.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Modifying the Wild Symbols</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        You can change which symbols are locked wilds for the next spin by tapping the symbols on the reels.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Tapping a wild symbol will remove it and reduce the cost of the 'LOCK &amp; SPIN').
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Tapping a normal symbol will change it to a locked Wild and increase the cost of the 'LOCK &amp; SPIN'.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Free spins</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Randomly, meerkats may appear at the bottom of the screen holding up letters after a spin.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If they hold up 5 letters (to spell 'BONUS') then the Free Spins bonus feature is activated.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The number of Free Spins awarded is always 8 and these are all played at the same total bet that was used when Free Spins were triggered.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Any wilds that were on the reels at the end of the spin where Free Spins were triggered will be locked and stay locked for all the Free Spins.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        During Free Spins, any new Wilds that appear will also lock in place for the remaining Free Spins.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        It is not possible to re-trigger Free Spins within Free Spins.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Free Spins use a different reel set to the normal reels; however the pay-out amounts are all the same.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        As with the normal  game, payouts in Free Spins are based on the line bet value.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Auto Play</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        By selecting 'AUTO PLAY' on the main game you can choose to place different numbers of bets automatically, one after the other. Alternatively you can choose to select &quot;UNTIL BONUS&quot; and then Auto Play will continue until the Free Spin bonus round is triggered. Select your bet as normal then tap the 'AUTO PLAY' button to select the number of 'Auto Play' bets you want before tapping the 'PLAY' button.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Auto Play will turn off if you get into the Free Spins bonus or do not have enough funds for the next bet.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        You can stop Auto Play from continuing onto the next spin by tapping the 'STOP' button at the bottom of the screen.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Auto Play will not lock any wilds - it will just play a normal spin.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Other Features</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        SOUND ON/OFF: Select this from the side menu to switch on/off all audio within the game.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        AUTO-LOCK ENABLED/DISABLED: When this says it is set to ENABLED (default setting) then it means that in LOCK &amp; SPIN any new wilds that appear on the reels will automatically be locked (and so the next LOCK &amp; SPIN will cost more). If this is DISABLED then new wilds will not be locked and only the original wilds (or ones selected manually by tapping on them) will be locked.
                    </li>
                </ul>
